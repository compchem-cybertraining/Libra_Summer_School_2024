 - Where: Natural Sciences Complex 220
 - Instructors: Sophya Garashchuk, Daeho Han, Alexey Akimov

# 2. QTAG and XF methods for Model Hamiltonians, VISTA 

## 2.1. Quantum Trajectories with Adaptive Gaussians (QTAG). Lecture (40 min) + Demo (30 min) + Hands on (30 min)

[Slides]()

Links:

Demo is after VISTA 

Hands on after lunch break

* Complete the tutorial: [5_qtag_1_basics](https://github.com/compchem-cybertraining/Tutorials_Libra/tree/master/6_dynamics/5_qtag/1_basics)

* Tasks: 

  - there are plenty exercises suggested in this tutorial - complete some of themy

  - compute the QTAG dynamics for your custom potential - compare to TSH and exact calculations
  
    Note: the QTAG is best performing for bound potentials or for relatively short time, where the wavepacket has not 
          branched too much. 


## 2.2. VISTA

[Check out VISTA webise](https://quantum-dynamics-hub.github.io/VISTA/)

## 2.3. Exact factorization (XF) theories and independent-trajectory XF methods. Lecture. (60 min)

[Slides]()


## 2.4. XF methods: SHXF, MQCXF, MFXF dynamics on model systems. Demo and Hands on (90 min)

[Slides]()

Links:

* Complete the tutorial: [11_model_xf](https://github.com/compchem-cybertraining/Tutorials_Libra/tree/master/6_dynamics/1_trajectory_based/11_model_xf)

* Tasks: 

  - run the XF calculations for your potential using different methods

        - try different methods: SHXF, MQCXF, MFXF

        - try different simulations: initial conditions, sampling, etc.

        - try using time-dependent widths

        - compute coherences and populations, compare them to the quantum results obtained in the second day

        - pay attention to the quality of the energy conservation
